This project demonstrates deploying a secure and scalable EC2-based web application using AWS services like Application Load Balancer (ALB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and CloudWatch.

## Use Case

Ideal for applications requiring:
- High availability
- Elastic scalability
- Cost optimization

## Architecture

- EC2 Instances
- ALB
- ASG
- RDS (optional)
- CloudWatch & SNS
- IAM Roles

## Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Launch infrastructure manually or using CloudFormation.
3. Upload app files to EC2.
4. Configure monitoring and scaling.

## Learning Outcomes

- High availability using ALB and ASG
- Auto Scaling with CloudWatch
- IAM-based access control
- RDS integration (optional)
